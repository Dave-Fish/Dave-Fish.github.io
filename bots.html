        My first discord bot. I made him to schedule my household, so that each morning he would send a message asking us to vote on whether we wanted to eat food together tonight. We could choose home cooked meal, takeaway, or do our own thing. If we all selected home cooked meal, he would follow up by asking us to vote on who should cook. He has a few more functions now, like regularly updating a friend group's server's icon. He's my basic personal utility bot.

        The Taskmaster! He runs my society for me mostly. He sends a random task of the week to the society discord and tags a random committee member to be the task marker for the week. He also randomly tags people with weird statements in the discord and randomly reacts with an emoji to every 100th message.

        Something I thought might be neat for the craft society. When prompted "I need a suggestion", it gives a random, completely silly, normally impossible craft idea for the member to try out.

        For pokemon go Aberystwyth, it sends a random pokemon of the day to the server. It also notices if people say the name of the pokemon of the day and responds accordingly.
