    <p class="highlight">If you scroll down from each "slide", more information will be available!</p>
    <p class="highlight">Press the left or right keys or swipe to navigate between slides.</p>
    <p>There is a one second delay after pressing  left or right, otherwise it cycles through the slides too quickly. (using keyup didn't fix it)</p>

    <p>The purpose of these webpages is to explain what on earth I have spent the 2024-2025 academic year (plus a bit) doing.<br>
    I have been doing a research masters in Aberystwyth University Computer Science department on <a href="https://www.dave.fish/vr">Spatial Frequency and Visual Comfort in VR</a>.</p>
