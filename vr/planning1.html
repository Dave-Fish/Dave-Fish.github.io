    <h3>Participants would hold a sphere with a texture in front of them<br>Press a button when optimum distance away</h3>
    
    <!-- Import the component -->

    <model-viewer

    ></model-viewer>

    <h3>Issues with this plan:</h3>
    <h2>Doesn't take up much of the participant's view, <br>
        What we'd be looking at is if the sphere as a whole is smaller or larger, <br>
        Participants are likely to physically recoil from particularly bad textures, <br>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairy_ball_theorem">Difficulty wrapping texture around a sphere</a> but sharp edges mess with the over all spatial frequency, <br>
        The angle the viewer looks at the sphere massively affects the spatial frequency, <br>
        Could keep the texture position relative to the viewport but difficulties implementing and takes away from the purpose of using VR</h2>
