        <p>
            May 2024, I completed my dissertation for my computer graphics, vision, and games undergraduate degree.<br>
            It was an awarded a 72%!<br>
            Which I am glad about, given the long hours I spent on it and how much I loved working on it.<br>
            <br>
            Feel free to download it here, but please credit me if you use it please. :)<br>
            Also if you end up using it for outreach or just for fun, drop me an email if you'd like!<br>
            I'd love to know what kinds of things it's being used for.<br>
            <br>
            Basically it takes a video input of someone moving and automatically turns them into a video game or animation character that can be used in <b><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/">scratch</a></b>. And your face looks really cool when it does.

        <p>Abstract:<br>
            <i>Scratch is a website that allows children and programming beginners to easily write
                code. It has a visual, user-friendly interface and is built for innovation and fun.<br>
                This report aims to describe the process in which a program that works with scratch was
                created. It allows a scratch user to generate a sprite of themselves automatically. The
                only necessary tools are their cameraâ€™s live video input and a machine running windows
                11.<br>
                Python was used to create the entire project. The work produced involved use of
                computer vision techniques and file manipulation. Open source computer vision
                (Open-cv) was the most useful external tool. It allowing for simple implementation of
                video input, data extraction, and image analysis.<br>
                Research into motion detection optimisation was done after the project reached its
                minimum requirements. An exhaustive search was performed on every combination of
                parameters within a Mixture of Gaussians algorithm. It was specifically designed to
                optimise the amount and consistency of sprite images saved when running the program.
