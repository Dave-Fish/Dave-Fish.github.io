        <h1>
            Hi I'm Lavender!
        </h1>
        <p>I'm one of the many Daves in here.</p>
        <P>I'm the first to make my web page on this website, so it might look a little off for a while.</P>
        <P>While my programming skills are reasonably sharp, I don't have as much of an interest in graphic design as some other Daves you might know.</P>
